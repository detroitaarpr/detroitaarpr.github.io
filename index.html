      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>
	We are a branch of the <a href="https://naarpr.org">National Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression</a> dedicated to getting justice for victims of police crimes, establishing community control of the police in the city of Detroit, and fighting racist and political repression wherever we find it. The Detroit Police Department have been surveilling, harassing, beating, and killing us, and for what? Not to keep us safe. Their job is to protect the interests and property of white billionaires like Dan Gilbert and the Illitches, to maintain downtown as a playground for suburbanites, and to be attack dogs and bodyguards for the fat cat real estate developers and landlords that are gentrifying our neighborhoods for profit. We need to take back control of our city and put the power in the hands of the community&mdash;we need to have control of <i>who</i> is policing our communities, <i>what</i> they are allowed to do, and <i>how</i> they are disciplined when they cause harm to our friends and neighbors. If you want to make this a reality, we'd like to hear from you.
      </p>
      <h2>Where to Find Us</h2>
      <p>
	We meet every other Friday at 6PM at <a href="https://27thletterbooks.com/">27th Letter Books</a> on Michigan Avenue in Detroit; please consider stopping by to learn about our work and give your input!
